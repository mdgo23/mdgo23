### Hi, I’m Marelyn
- 👀 I’m currently a sophomore at Wellesley College pursuing a major in Computer Science and minor in Statistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently an AI Studio Fellow with Cadence Design Systems where I am working with a team of four other students to develop
  a CNN binary classification model to determine whether a printed circuit board design is good/bad based on key metrics such as number of crossings.
- 💞️ I’m interested in the intersections between space explorations and AI, accessibility and AI, and how AI impacts our society.
- 📫 How to reach me: gmarelyn023@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do karate and am on the e-board at Wellesley's Shotokan Karate Club!
